        Basics of the Web

        <p>
          The "web" or internet as it is known is a network of computers and other connected devices that are able to send requests to each other as well as web servers in an effort to communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          A device sends a request out to a web server and the web server then uses what is known as DNS in an effort to connect that device to the web page. Once the device receives this communication from the webpage the browser displays that <em>website</em> on the screen.

        HTML

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          HTML = <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. These are web documents on the internet. The web is consisted mostly of HTML documents. Websites are considered HTML documents. HTML is the language that computers use to interpret how to display the document to its user.

        Tags and Elements
      </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            When you write HTML code you use things called tags and elements to format your web page. Without these tags and elements the web browser does not know how to interpret the commands that the developer wishes to display to users.

          Inline vs. Block
        </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              Elements are either inline or block. Inline elements stay within the same line on the page while block elements have an invisibile box around them thus creating a format for the source.

            The <em>web browser</em> Google Chrome offers a tool Called <em>Developer Tools</em>. This allows the user to view the HTML code and CSS Style to inspect both languages and experiment with the code to make changes and learn how the HTML and CSS code was developed.

          The Tree Structure
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            Remember that web pages are made up of "boxes." When these boxes are inside other boxes they are called <em>nested elements.</em> When elements are nested together they create a tree-like structure within the HTML. They have a releationship much like a mother or father has a relationship with their children.

          HTML and Nesting
        </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              As you are reading the HTML code in a document you may notice that the coding itself has indentations. As the code gets more and more indented, this represents deeper nesting within that tree-like structure that we talked about with the elements of the HTML.

              <p>
                Programmers use programs called <em>Text Editors</em> to help them write their code. There are a number of text editors available on the web to use. Typically the text editing program makes the code easier to read with different colors and features that make coding for a programmer much easier than reading and writing a bunch of black text on a white background. Most editors give suggestions for HTML commands and elements as you type and also close your HTML tag for you when you write the opening tag so you do not forget as this is a common mistakke, especially for a beginning programmer.

            Avoiding Repetition
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              There are a few of reasons to avoid repetition.
            </p>
              <h4>Consistency:</h4>
              <p>
                By making your HTML and web page consistent you give it good structure that allows you to avoid repetition. Using a CSS Sheet to develop your code allows you to avoid writing the same code over and over inside of your HTML to style the page. Instead of writing it multiple times you only have to write it once. The allows for more consistency throughout your document.
              </p>
              <h4>Avoid Errors:</h4>
              <p>
                Additionally, by reducing the amount of code you have to write by using a CSS sheet you give yourself the opportunity to reduce the amount of errors within your code.
              </p>
              <h4>Ease/Simplicity:</h4>
              <p>
                Simply put, when you avoid repetition it makes it easier to write and develop your code which allows you to focus more on the experience that you want to give your users.

            CSS
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              CSS is also known as a Cascading Style Sheet. CSS gives the programmer the option to create the style of the page and elements. Elements can have class names and id's that are linked to the CSS stylesheet to keep the style of the page consistent and the coding simple.
